# Project_3 - Bootcamp Sunseekers

About this project:

The objective for this project was to analyse data in the solar energy industry and identify regions of Australia with the highest potential for growth in the solar panel installation business. We have created a website that reviews APVI’s solar panel data for postcodes, regions and states and showcase’s our findings.

This project utilizes data sourced from the Australian PV Institute's website and integrates it with Australian Postcodes found using the Geoapify API via Jupyter Notebook.. 

The purpose of the data collection was to review:
- Top 10 suburbs with potential capacity in each state
- Overall number of dwellings installations available for in each state
- Current capacity vs potential kw capacity in each state & postcode
- Show number of installations in each postcode & region
- Show average capacity per dwelling & installation in each postcode 

We used SQL to create the database, then power our website using a Python Flask API, and build our website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript & various JavaScript libraries.

# Technologies used:

     SQL
     Python
     Flask
     Javascript
     JavaScript libraries: Leaflet, Plotly & Chart
